## Docker Storage
- When it comes to storage in Docker, there are two concepts.
    - Storage drivers
    - Volume drivers

### Filesystem

- Let's see how Docker stores data on the local file system. At the first time, When you install Docker on a system, it creates this directory structures at /var/lib/docker.

  ```console
  $ cd /var/lib/docker/
  ```

- Docker - image - container

![image](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/class6.PNG)

  - When you run a container based off of the image with image layers, using the **Docker run** command Docker creates a container based off of these layers and creates a new writeable layer on top of the image layer. 
  - The writeable layer is used to store data created by the container such as log files written by the applications, any temporary files generated by the container.
  - The life of Container layer though is only as long as the container is alive. When the container is destroyed, this layer and all of the changes stored in it are also destroyed.
  - **Remember that the same image layer is shared by all containers created using this image.**

- Update image layer data as a copy-on-write

![dd](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/class7.PNG)

  - Let's take an example of our application code. Since we bake our code into the image, the code is part of the image and as such, its read-only. After running a container, what if I wish to modify the source code.
  - Yes, I can still modify this file, but before I saved the modified file, Docker automatically creates a copy of the file in the read-write layer and I will then be modifying a different version of the file in the read-write layer. All future modifications will be done on this copy of the file in the read-write layer. This is called **copy-on-write** mechanism.
  - The Image layer being a read-only just means that the files in these layers will not be modified in the image itself. So, the image will remain the same all the time until you rebuild the image using the Docker build command. **If container destroyed then all of the data that was stored in the container layer also gets deleted.**


- So what if we wish to persist this data?
  - we could add a **persistent volume** to the container.
  - To do this first create a volume using the docker volume create command.
  - So when I run the docker volume create data underscore volume command, it creates a folder called data underscore volume under the VAR lib docker volumes directory.
  - Then when I run the docker container using the `docker run` command, I could mount this volume inside the docker containers rewrite layer using the dash V option like this.
  
  ![mount](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/class8.PNG)
  
  - This will create a new container and mount the data volume we created into VAR lib mysql folder inside the container. So all data written by the database is in fact stored on the volume created on the Docker host.

- You should be able to see all these volumes if you list the contents of the `/var/lib/docker` volumes directory. This is called **Volume mounting**.
- What if we had our data already at another location?
- Let's say we have some external storage on the Docker host at `/data` path and we would like to store database data on that volume and not in the default `/var/lib/docker` volumes directory. In that case, we would run a container using the command `docker run -v`. But in this case, we will provide the complete path to the directory we would like to mount. That is `/data/mysql` and so it will create a container and mount the directory to the container. This is called **Bind mounting**.
- So there are two types of mounts, volume mount and bind mount.
  * Volume mount, mounts of volume from the volumes directory and bind mount, mounts indirectly from any location on the Docker host.
- Instead of `-v` option, we can preferred `--mount` option.

  ```
  $ mkdir -p /data/mysql
  $ docker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql
  ```
- So, who is responsible for doing all of these Operations? 
- Maintaining of layered architecture, creating a writeable layer, moving files across layers to enable copy and write etc. It's the **Storage Drivers**.
- Docker uses storage drivers to enable layered architecture.

#### Common Storage Drivers

- AUFS
- ZFS
- BTRFS
- Device Mapper
- Overlay
- Overlay2

- To Selection of the storage drivers depends on the underlying OS. Docker will choose the best storage driver available automatically based on the operating system.

## Container Storage Interface

![cc](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/class13.PNG)

### Container Runtime Interface

- Kubernetes used Docker alone as the container runtime engine, and all the code to work with Docker was embedded within the Kubernetes source code. Other container runtimes, such as rkt and CRI-O.
- The Container Runtime Interface is a standard that defines how an orchestration solution like Kubernetes would communicate with container runtimes like Docker. If any new container runtime interace is developed, they can simply follow the CRI standards.

### Container Networking Interface

- To support different networking solutions, the container networking interface was introduced. Any new networking vendors could simply develop their plugin based on the CNI standards and make their solution work with Kubernetes.

### Container Storage Interface

- The container storage interface was developed to support multiple storage solutions. With CSI, you can now write your own drivers for your own storage to work with Kubernetes. Portworx, Amazon EBS, Azure Disk, GlusterFS etc.
- CSI is not a Kubernetes specific standard. It is meant to be a universal standard and if implemented, allows any container orchestration tool to work with any storage vendor with a supported plugin. Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry and Mesos are onboard with CSI.
- It defines a set of RPCs or remote procedure calls that will be called by the container orchestrator. These must be implemented by the storage drivers.
