# Section 6 - Cluster Maintenance
- [OS Upgrade](#OS-Upgrade)  
- [Cluster Upgrade](#Cluster-Upgrade)  

- **Cluster**
    - A Kubernetes cluster is a set of **node machines** for running containerized applications. If you’re running Kubernetes, you’re running a cluster.
    - At a minimum, **a cluster contains a control plane and one or more compute machines, or nodes.** The control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Nodes actually run the applications and workloads.
    - The cluster is the heart of Kubernetes’ key advantage: **the ability to schedule and run containers across a group of machines**, be they physical or virtual, on premises or in the cloud. **Kubernetes containers aren’t tied to individual machines. Rather, they’re abstracted across the cluster.**

## OS Upgrade

- When you `drain` a node, the pods are gracefully **terminated** from the node that they're on and recreated on another.

- The node is also cordoned or marked as unschedulable,meaning no pods can be scheduled on this node until you specifically remove the restriction.

> **cordon**  
> prevent access to or from an area or building by surrounding it with police or other guards.


- `Cordon` simply marks a node unschedulable.
- Unlike drain, it **does not terminate** or move the pods on an existing node. It simply makes sure that new pods are not scheduled on that node.

### Practice
- How many applications do you see hosted on the cluster?

```console
~# kubectl get deploy
```

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s
```

- `NAME` lists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.
- `READY` displays how many replicas of the **application** are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.
- `UP-TO-DATE` displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
- `AVAILABLE` displays how many replicas of the **application** are available to your users.
- `AGE` displays the amount of time that the **application** has been running.

- Run the command **`kubectl get pods -o wide`** and get the list of nodes the pods are placed on

- Need to take `node01` out for maintenance

```console
~# kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
```

- Configure the `node01` to be scheduled again

```console
~# k uncordon node01
```

- We do not want to schedule any more pods on `node01` and don't want current pods to be removed
```console
~# kubectl cordon node01 
```

## Cluster Upgrade

![version1](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/kgn.PNG)

![version2](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/mmp.PNG)

![k](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course/blob/master/images/up2.PNG)

- Since the `kube-apiserver` is the primary component in the control plane and that is the component that all other components talk to.

- None of the other components should ever be at a version higher than the `kube-apiserver`.

- Now this is not the case with `kubectl`, the kubectl utility could be at 1.11, a version higher than the `kube-apiserver`.

- **At any time, kubernetes supports only up to the recent 3 minor versions**

- Do we upgrade directly from 1.10 to 1.13?  NO. The recommended approach is to upgrade **one minor version at a time.**

- **kubeadm**: the command to bootstrap the cluster.

- **kubelet**: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.

- **kubectl**: the command line util to talk to your cluster.

- Upgrading a cluster involves two major steps.
    - First, you upgrade your master nodes
    - and then upgrade the worker nodes

### Practice

- Check version of the cluster

- What is the latest stable version of Kubernetes as of today?

  <details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```console
  ~# kubeadm upgrade plan 
  ```
  
  </details>
  

- Upgrade the controlplane components to exact version v1.26.0

    - Search K8s documentation with keyword `upgrade`
        - [Upgrade](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)

    - Check system version (In this case - `Ubuntu`)

    ```console
    controlplane ~#  cat /etc/*release*
    DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
    DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
    DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
    DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS"
    NAME="Ubuntu"
    VERSION="20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
    ID=ubuntu
    ID_LIKE=debian
    PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS"
    VERSION_ID="20.04"
    HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
    SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
    BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
    PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
    VERSION_CODENAME=focal
    UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
    ```

    - Determine which version to upgrade to
    ```console
    apt update
    apt-cache madison kubeadm
    ```

    - Upgrading control plane
    ```
    # replace x in 1.26.x-00 with the latest patch version
    apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.26.x-00 && \
    apt-mark hold kubeadm
    ```

    - Verify that the download works and has the expected version:
    ```console
    kubeadm version
    ```
    - Verify the upgrade plan:
    ```console
    kubeadm upgrade plan
    ```
    This command checks that your cluster can be upgraded, and fetches the versions you can upgrade to. It also shows a table with the component config version states.


    - Choose a version to upgrade to, and run the appropriate command. For example:
    ```console
    # replace x with the patch version you picked for this upgrade
    sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.26.x
    ```

    - Upgrade kubelet and kubectl
    ```
    # replace x in 1.26.x-00 with the latest patch version
    apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.26.x-00 kubectl=1.26.x-00 && \
    apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
    ```

    - Restart the kubelet:
    ```console
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

    - Uncordon the node
    ```console
    Bring the node back online by marking it schedulable:

    # replace <node-to-uncordon> with the name of your node
    kubectl uncordon <node-to-uncordon>
    ```    

- Upgrade worker node
    - **ssh worker node**
    
    ```console
    ~# k get nodes -o  wide
    NAME           STATUS                     ROLES           AGE    VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
    controlplane   Ready                      control-plane   123m   v1.25.0   192.24.222.3   <none>        Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1102-gcp   containerd://1.6.6
    node01         Ready,SchedulingDisabled   <none>          122m   v1.25.0   192.24.222.6   <none>        Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1102-gcp   containerd://1.6.6

    ~# ssh 192.24.222.6
    root@node01 ~#  
    ```

    - Type exit or logout or enter `CTRL + d` to go back to the controlplane node.
