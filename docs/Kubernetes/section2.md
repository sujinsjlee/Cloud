## Cluster-Architecture
- **The purpose of Kubernetes** 
    - Host the applications in the form of containers in an automated fashion so that it can be easily deployed as many instances of the application

- **Master**
    > Manage, plan, schedule, monitor nodes  

    - **Kube Controller Manager**
        - Manages various Controller in K8s
            - Controller Manager
            - Node-Controller
            - Replication Controller : If the POD dies, it creates another one
        - Watch Status
        - Remediate Situation
    - **ETCD Cluster**
        - Now, there are many containers being loaded and unloaded from the ships on a daily basis
        - Need to maintain information about the different ships, what container is on which ship and what time it was loaded, etc.
        - All of these are stored in a highly available key value store, known as etcd.
        - *Etcd is a database that stores information in a key value format.*
    - **kube-scheduler**
        - A scheduler identifies the right node to place a container on based on the containers resource requirements
        - *Decide which POD goes to which node*
        1) Filter Nodes  
        2) Rank Nodes (Use priority function)  

    - **kube-apiserver**
        - Orchestration
        1) Authenticate User  
        2) Validate Request  
        3) Retrieve data  
        4) Update ETCD  
          - kube-apiserver is the only component that interacts directly with the etcd data store.
        5) Scheduler  
        6) Kubelet  

- **Worker node**
    > Host Application as Containers  


    - **kublet**
        - A kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in a cluster.
        - It listens for instructions from the Kube API server and deploys or destroys containers on the nodes as required.
        - *The kube-apiserver periodically fetches status reports from the kubelet to monitor the status of nodes and containers on them.*
    - **Kube-proxy**
        - The Kube Proxy Service ensures that the necessary rules are in place on the worker nodes to allow the containers running on them to reach each other.

## ETCD
> The etcd data store stores information regarding the cluster such as the nodes, pods, Configs, secrets, accounts, roles, role bindings, and others. Every information you see when you run the kube control get command is from the etcd server. Every change you make to your cluster such as adding additional nodes, deploying pods or replica sets are updated in the etcd server.

## Kublet

- Register Node
    - The kubelet in the Kubernetes worker node **registers the node** with a Kubernetes cluster.

- Create PODs
    - **When it receives instructions to load a container or a pod** on the node  
    - **it requests** the container runtime engine, which may be **Docker, to pull the required image and run an instance.**

- Monitor Node & PODs
    -  monitor the state of the pod and containers in it and reports to the kube API server on a timely basis.

- View kubelet options

    ```shell
    $ ps -aus | grep kubelet
    ```

## Kube Proxy


- Kube-proxy is a process that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Its job is to look for new services, and every time a new service is created, it creates the appropriate rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to the backend pods.


## POD

- Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on the worker nodes.
- The containers are encapsulated into a Kubernetes object known as pods.
- A pod is a single instance of an application.
- A pod is the smallest object that you can create in Kubernetes.
- pods usually have a one-to-one relationship with containers running your application.
- To scale up, you create new pods.
- And to scale down, you delete existing pod.
- But sometimes you might have a scenario where you have a helper container
    - In this case, Pod with Multi-containers are acceptable

- kubectl

    - Get the application image
    
    ```shell
    $ kubectl run nginx --image nginx
    ```

    - See the list of PODs
    
    ```shell
    $ kubectl get pods
    ```

    - Detail information of PODs
    
    ```shell
    $ kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
    ```

- [PODs with YAML](https://github.com/mg729/Cloud/blob/master/docs/Kubernetes/podsWithYaml.md)  

### Practice

- Create a new pod with the `nginx` image.
    ```shell
    $ kubectl run --help
    $ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
    pod/nginx created
    ```

- Check pods details

    ```shell
    $ kubectl get pods

- What does the `READY` column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?
    - Running Containers in POD / Total Conatiners in POD

- `--dry-run=client` option 
    - You can use the `--dry-run=client` flag to preview the object that would be sent to your cluster, without really submitting it.

- kubectl run & create Difference
    - kubectl create : create resource from a file
    - `$ kubectl create -f FILENAME`

    - kubectl run : Create and run a particular image in a pod
    - `$ kubectl run NAME --image=image [--env="key=value"] [--port=port] [--dry-run=server|client] [--overrides=inline-json] [--command] -- [COMMAND] [args...]`
