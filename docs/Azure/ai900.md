# Fundamental AI Concepts

## Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement
- **Supervised Learning**
    - Data that has been labeled for training 
    - make a prediction
    - When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome
    - *eg. Classification, Regression*

- **Unsupervised Learning**
    - Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling
    - recognize a structure or pattern
    - When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise
    - *eg. Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association*

- **Reinforcement Learning**
    - There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data any many attempt to reach a goal 
    - Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation

## Inference
- Inference is the act of requesting to make a prediction

## Forecasting / Prediction
- Forecasting makes a future prediction with **relevant data**
    - It's not guessing
- Prediction makes a future prediction without **relevant data**
    - It's more of guessing
## Regression
- Regression is a process of finding a function to correlate a labeled dataset into continuous variable/ number
- Outcome : Predict this variable in the future
- eg. 20 Celsius

## Classification
- Classification is a process of finding a function to *divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories*
- Outcome: Predict **category** to apply to the inputted data
- eg. Sunny, Rainy 

## Clustering
- Clustering is a process grouping unlabeld data based on similarities and differences

## LUIS 
- Language Understanding (LUIS) is a no code ML service to build natural language into apps

## QnA Maker service
- It is a bloud-based NLP service

##  Azure Machine Learning Service
- AL/ML workloads allowing you to build Auto ML Pipeline

## Azure ML Studio - Data Store
- Azure Blob Storage
    - data is stored as objects, distributed across many machinges
- Azure File Share
    - a mountable file share via SMB and NFS protocols
- Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2)
    - Azure Blob storage desinge for vasts amount of data for Big Data analytics
- Azure SQL database
    - Full-managed MS SQL relational database
- Azure Postgres database
    - open-source relational database
- Azure MySQL Database
    - Open-source relational database


## Azure ML Studio - Endpoints
- It allows you to deploy machine learning models as a web service

## AutoML
- Automated ML automates the process of creating an ML model

<!--
Classification과 Regression의 주된 차이는 classification의 경우 남성 vs 여성, 참 vs 거짓 등의 discrete한 value를 예측/분류하는데 사용되고, regression은 가격, 급여, 나이 등과 같은 continuous한 value를 예측
-->
- Task type
    - **Classification**
        - When you need to make a prediction based on several classes
        - binary classification : Yes or No
        - multi-class classification : RED/BLUE/Green

    - **Regression**
        - When you need to predict a continuous number value

    - **Time Series Forecasting**
        - When you need to predict the value based on time

## AutoML - Explanation
- ML Explainabiity (**MLX**) is the process of explaining and interpreting ML and deep learning models. MLX can help machine learning developers to better understand and interpret the model's behavior
