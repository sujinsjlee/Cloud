# Fundamental AI Concepts

## Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement
- **Supervised Learning**
    - Data that has been labeled for training 
    - make a prediction
    - When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome
    - *eg. Classification, Regression*

- **Unsupervised Learning**
    - Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling
    - recognize a structure or pattern
    - When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise
    - *eg. Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association*

- **Reinforcement Learning**
    - There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data any many attempt to reach a goal 
    - Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation

## Inference
- Inference is the act of requesting to make a prediction

## Forecasting / Prediction
- Forecasting makes a future prediction with **relevant data**
    - It's not guessing
- Prediction makes a future prediction without **relevant data**
    - It's more of guessing
## Regression
- Regression is a process of finding a function to correlate a labeled dataset into continuous variable/ number
- Outcome : Predict this variable in the future
- eg. 20 Celsius

## Classification
- Classification is a process of finding a function to *divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories*
- Outcome: Predict **category** to apply to the inputted data
- eg. Sunny, Rainy 

## Clustering
- Clustering is a process grouping unlabeld data based on similarities and differences
- Clustering is used to group instances of data into clusters that contain **similar** characteristics. Clustering can also be used to identify relationships in a dataset

## LUIS 
- Language Understanding (LUIS) is a no code ML service to build natural language into apps

## QnA Maker service
- It is a bloud-based NLP service

##  Azure Machine Learning Service
- AL/ML workloads allowing you to build Auto ML Pipeline

## Azure ML Studio - Data Store
- Azure Blob Storage
    - data is stored as objects, distributed across many machinges
- Azure File Share
    - a mountable file share via SMB and NFS protocols
- Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2)
    - Azure Blob storage desinge for vasts amount of data for Big Data analytics
- Azure SQL database
    - Full-managed MS SQL relational database
- Azure Postgres database
    - open-source relational database
- Azure MySQL Database
    - Open-source relational database


## Azure ML Studio - Endpoints
- It allows you to deploy machine learning models as a web service

## AutoML
- Automated ML automates the process of creating an ML model

Classification과 Regression의 주된 차이는 classification의 경우 남성 vs 여성, 참 vs 거짓 등의 discrete한 value를 예측/분류하는데 사용되고, regression은 가격, 급여, 나이 등과 같은 continuous한 value를 예측

- Task type
    - **Classification**
        - When you need to make a prediction based on several classes
        - binary classification : Yes or No
        - multi-class classification : RED/BLUE/Green

    - **Regression**
        - When you need to predict a continuous number value

    - **Time Series Forecasting**
        - When you need to predict the value based on time

## AutoML - Explanation
- ML Explainabiity (**MLX**) is the process of explaining and interpreting ML and deep learning models. MLX can help machine learning developers to better understand and interpret the model's behavior

B. Randomly split the data into rows for training and rows for evaluation.

B. Enable Expalin best model
 : Model Explain ability

B. Confidence
 : calculated probability of a correct image classificaiton

C. Reliability and Safety
 : unusual or missing values

C. Feature selection
 : Ensuring that the numeric variable in training data are on a similar scale 
A. Feture engineering
 : It is used to generate additional features

A. Computer Vision
 : Images of building's windows can be analyzed with computer vision and classified into groups based on windshield condition
 : Abnormaly Detection (it is used to analyze data over time and identify unusual changes)
 : Detect faces in an image
 : Recognize handwritten text
 : OCR (Optical Character Recognition) extracts text from images
 
B. Regression
 : Want to predict Numeric value ? Choose Regression ex. Price...
 : coefficient of determination (R2)
 : root mean wquared error (RMSE)

B. Custom Vision
 : Use to train an object detection model by using own image
 : You can specify whether it is to be used for training, prediction or both

C. the authentifcation key
D. the REST endpoint
 : to publish an inference pipeline, the above two parameters should be usded to consume the pipeline

C. AKS Azure Kubernetes Service
 : to deploy a real time inferenct pipeline

A. Form Recognizer
 : extract text, key/value pairs, and table data automatically from scanned documents

A. Objects
 ; Computer Vision retunrns objects with a bounding box to indicate their location in the image

B. Cognitive Services
 : A Cognitive Services resource support both Computer Vision and Language
 : A Cognitive service resource can be used for both training and prediction
 : A Cognitive Services resource support both Computer Vision for text extraction, and Text Analytics for text analysis

B. Split Data
 : Use a Split Data model to randomly split a dataset into test and validation subsets

[NO] Azure ML designer enables you to include custom Javascript functions

B. the Detect operation in the Face service

A. transparency
 : design AI system assess whether credit card applications should be approved, the factors used to make the decision should be explainable

C. A class label, probability, and bounding box for each objects in the image
 : object detection model typically return for the image

A. The Read API
 : Read API better suited for larger images. Additionally, it runs asynchronously so it will not block your application while it is running

C. A set of coordinates for each face, defining a rectangular bounding box around the face
 : The location of detected faces are indicated by a coordinates for a rectangular bounding box

C. Use Face to create a group containing multiple images of each named individual, and train a model based on the group

B. Form Recognizer or Cognitive Services resource

B. 50MB
 : The maximum file size for the pre-built receipt model is 50MB

[Privacy and Security] : Personal data must be visible only to approve

The Text Anlytics service
[YES] can identify in which language text is written
[NO] can detect handwritten signatures in a docuement
[YES] can identify companies and organizations mentioned in a document

[YES] Automated machine learning provides you with the ability to include custom python scripts in a training pipeline

## Difference Between Classification and Clustering

- Classification sorts data into specific categories using a labeled dataset. 
- Clustering is partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups of similar objects
