- **Management levels and hierarchy**

- ![hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)

    - Management groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions that are applied to the management group.

    - Subscriptions logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.

    - Resource groups are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

    - Resources are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases.

- **Operating Expense (OPEX)**: The ongoing expenses for a business. For example, a maintenance payment or periodic bill for Azure services.

- **Capital Expense (CAPEX)**: The upfront investment in equipment. This equipment is capitalized as an asset and put on your balance sheet. For example, payment for the hardware in advance.

<!--

You are planning to migrate a company to Azure. Each of the company's numerous divisions will have an administrator in place to manage the Azure resources used by their respective division.
You want to make sure that the Azure deployment you employ allows for Azure to be segmented for the divisions, while keeping administrative effort to a minimum.
Solution: You plan to make use of several Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories.
Does the solution meet the goal?
* NO

++) Creating multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories for each division is not the most suitable solution for achieving segmentation of Azure resources for divisions. While it's technically possible to have separate Azure AD directories for different divisions, this approach can lead to increased administrative complexity and additional management overhead. Managing multiple directories could require more effort and potentially result in a less cohesive and efficient setup.

A more suitable solution would involve using Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate permissions to administrators within a single Azure AD directory. This way, you can achieve the desired segmentation of resources while minimizing administrative effort. Each division's administrator can be assigned specific roles and permissions to manage their respective resources within the same Azure AD directory.
