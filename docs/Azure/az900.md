- **Management levels and hierarchy**

- ![hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/media/organize-resources/scope-levels.png)

    - Management groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions that are applied to the management group.

    - Subscriptions logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.

    - Resource groups are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

    - Resources are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases.

- **Operating Expense (OPEX)**: The ongoing expenses for a business. For example, a maintenance payment or periodic bill for Azure services.

- **Capital Expense (CAPEX)**: The upfront investment in equipment. This equipment is capitalized as an asset and put on your balance sheet. For example, payment for the hardware in advance.

<!--

You are planning to migrate a company to Azure. Each of the company's numerous divisions will have an administrator in place to manage the Azure resources used by their respective division.
You want to make sure that the Azure deployment you employ allows for Azure to be segmented for the divisions, while keeping administrative effort to a minimum.
Solution: You plan to make use of several Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories.
Does the solution meet the goal?
* NO

++) Creating multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories for each division is not the most suitable solution for achieving segmentation of Azure resources for divisions. While it's technically possible to have separate Azure AD directories for different divisions, this approach can lead to increased administrative complexity and additional management overhead. Managing multiple directories could require more effort and potentially result in a less cohesive and efficient setup.

A more suitable solution would involve using Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign appropriate permissions to administrators within a single Azure AD directory. This way, you can achieve the desired segmentation of resources while minimizing administrative effort. Each division's administrator can be assigned specific roles and permissions to manage their respective resources within the same Azure AD directory.

Q17/ Your company's infrastructure includes a number of business units that each need a large number of various Azure resources for everyday operation.
The resources required by each business unit are identical.
You are required to sanction a strategy to create Azure resources automatically.
Solution: You recommend that management groups be included in the strategy.
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

B. No. Management groups are used to organize resources and manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions, but they are not specifically designed for automatically creating Azure resources[1]. Instead, consider using Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) or Azure Blueprints for automating the creation and management of Azure resources.

What should you do?
A. Configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.
B. Configure a VNet-toVNet VPN.
C. Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN.
D. Configure DirectAccess on a Windows Server 2012 server VM.

Q27 / You have been informed by your superiors of the company's intentions to automate server deployment to Azure. There is, however, some concern that administrative credentials could be uncovered during this process.
You are required to make sure that during the deployment, the administrative credentials are encrypted using a suitable Azure solution.
Solution: You recommend the use of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

NO
-->
- Key vault
    - To encrypt administrative credentials during server deployment to Azure, a better solution would be to use Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault is a cloud-based service that provides secure storage of keys, secrets, and certificates. By storing the administrative credentials in Azure Key Vault, they can be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

This strategy should allow for connection types between the web servers and database servers to be controlled.
Solution: You include network security groups (NSGs) in your strategy.
Does the solution meet the goal?

Yes

-->
- NSG
    - You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

Q40/
Answer: Pay monthly usage costs.

Explanation:
When migrating a public website to Azure, you need to plan for the pricing model that Azure provides. Azure charges for the usage of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and data transfer. Therefore, you need to plan to pay monthly usage costs for hosting the website on Azure. Deploying a VPN, paying to transfer all the website data to Azure, or reducing the number of connections to the website are not necessarily required for migrating a public website to Azure

NYY
Azure resources can only access other resouces in the same resource group
If you delete a resource group all the resources in the resource group will be deleted
A resource group can contain resources from multiple Azure regions

Deleting the resource group will remove the resource group as well as all the resources in that resource group. This can be useful for the management of resources. For example, a virtual machine has several components (the VM itself, virtual disks, network adapter etc.). By placing the VM in its own resource group, you can delete the VM along with all its associated components by deleting the resource group.
Another example is when creating a test environment. You could place the entire test environment (Network components, virtual machines etc.) in one resource group. You can then delete the entire test environment by deleting the resource group.
