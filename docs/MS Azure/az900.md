- **Management levels and hierarchy**

    - Management groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions that are applied to the management group.

    - Subscriptions logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.

    - Resource groups are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

    - Resources are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases.

- **Operating Expense (OPEX)**: The ongoing expenses for a business. For example, a maintenance payment or periodic bill for Azure services.

- **Capital Expense (CAPEX)**: The upfront investment in equipment. This equipment is capitalized as an asset and put on your balance sheet. For example, payment for the hardware in advance.
