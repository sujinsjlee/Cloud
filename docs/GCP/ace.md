Q2

You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet's range must be as large as possible. Which range should you use?
A. 0.0.0.0/0
B. 10.0.0.0/8
C. 172.16.0.0/12
D. 192.168.0.0/16

B

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), when creating a VPC network, you should use the IP ranges that are reserved for private networks as defined by the RFC 1918. Here are the private IP address ranges defined by RFC 1918:

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
From the provided options:

A. 0.0.0.0/0: This is not a private IP address range. It represents all possible IP addresses.

B. 10.0.0.0/8: This is a private IP range that covers all IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255. It's the largest range among the options.

C. 172.16.0.0/12: This is a private IP range, but it's smaller than 10.0.0.0/8.

D. 192.168.0.0/16: This is also a private IP range, but it's smaller than both B and C.

So, if you want the subnet's range to be as large as possible:

The correct answer is B. 10.0.0.0/8.


Q3

You want to select and configure a cost-effective solution for relational data on Google Cloud Platform. You are working with a small set of operational data in one geographic location. You need to support point-in-time recovery. What should you do?
A. Select Cloud SQL (MySQL). Verify that the enable binary logging option is selected.
B. Select Cloud SQL (MySQL). Select the create failover replicas option.
C. Select Cloud Spanner. Set up your instance with 2 nodes.
D. Select Cloud Spanner. Set up your instance as multi-regional.

A

특정 시점 복구를 사용하려면 바이너리 로깅을 활성화해야 합니다. 

바이너리 로깅을 활성화하면 쓰기 성능이 약간 저하됩니다.

B가 적합하지 않은 이유는 Failover replicas는 특정 시점을 기록하지 않고 복구를 위해 마지막 상태만 백업하기 때문입니다. Cloud Spanner는 대규모 데이터 세트에 적합하므로 C, D가 올바르지 않습니다.


Q4

You want to configure autohealing for network load balancing for a group of Compute Engine instances that run in multiple zones, using the fewest possible steps.
You need to configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. What should you do?
A. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)
B. Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.
C. Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP)
D. Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.

C

A, B에 해당하는 로드 밸런서 상태 확인은 VM을 중지하고 새 VM을 회전시키지 않으며 트래픽을 정상 VM으로 만 리디렉션합니다. 특히 B는 RPS가 균형을 위해 VM에 대한 초당 요청은 치유와 관련 없음

또한, 자동 확장이 관련이 없으므로 D는 잘못되었습니다.


Q5

You are using multiple configurations for gcloud. You want to review the configured Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration using the fewest possible steps. What should you do?
A. Use gcloud config configurations describe to review the output.
B. Use gcloud config configurations activate and gcloud config list to review the output.
C. Use kubectl config get-contexts to review the output.
D. Use kubectl config use-context and kubectl config view to review the output.

D

Answer A: Using `gcloud config configurations described` will only show you the details of the current configuration, not the Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration.

Answer B: Using `gcloud config configurations activate` and `gcloud config list` to review the output will only show you the list of configurations and activate one of them, but it won't provide you with the details of the Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration.

Answer C: Using `kubectl config get-contexts` will only list the available contexts, including their clusters, but it won't provide you with the details of the Kubernetes Engine cluster of an inactive configuration.


Q9

You are deploying an application to App Engine. You want the number of instances to scale based on request rate. You need at least 3 unoccupied instances at all times. Which scaling type should you use?
A. Manual Scaling with 3 instances.
B. Basic Scaling with min_instances set to 3.
C. Basic Scaling with max_instances set to 3.
D. Automatic Scaling with min_idle_instances set to 3.

D

Q11
You need a dynamic way of provisioning VMs on Compute Engine. The exact specifications will be in a dedicated configuration file. You want to follow Google's recommended practices. Which method should you use?
A. Deployment Manager
B. Cloud Composer
C. Managed Instance Group
D. Unmanaged Instance Group

A

Deployment Manager is a configuration management tool that allows you to define and deploy a set of resources, including Compute Engine VMs, in a declarative manner. 

Managed Instance Group (option C) and Unmanaged Instance Group (option D) are Compute Engine features that allow you to group related VM instances and manage them as a single entity. However, they do not provide a dynamic way of provisioning VMs based on a configuration file like Deployment Manager does.

Managed Instance Groups (MIG) and Unmanaged Instance Groups can be used for managing groups of identical instances, but they might not be as suitable for dynamic provisioning based on a configuration file, as they are designed for maintaining a specified number of instances in a group.


Q13
You have a Dockerfile that you need to deploy on Kubernetes Engine. What should you do?
A. Use kubectl app deploy <dockerfilename>.
B. Use gcloud app deploy <dockerfilename>.
C. Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Container Registry. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.
D. Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Cloud Storage. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.

C
도커파일에서 도커 이미지를 만들고 컨테이너 레지스트에 업로드 후 해당 이미지를 가리키는 배포 YAML 파일을 만들어야 함, 또한 kubectl을 사용하여 GKE로 푸시 처리함

참고로 컨테이너 레지스트리는 도커 파일이 저장되는 곳으로 GKE, Cloud Run 또는

App Engine flexible에 배포 가능함

A의 경우는 도커 파일만 언급되었고 컨테이너 이미지가 없어서 불가함


Q20
You created an instance of SQL Server 2017 on Compute Engine to test features in the new version. You want to connect to this instance using the fewest number of steps. What should you do?

B. Install a RDP client in your desktop. Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Use the credentials to log in to the instance.
C. Set a Windows password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 22 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console and supply the credentials to log in.
D. Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console, and supply the credentials to log in.

D
RDP 클릭 시 사용자 이름과 암호를 묻는 메시지가 표시되므로
이러한 자격 증명을 설정하고 포트가 열려 있는지 확인 후 연결을 해야 함
RDP 클라이언트를 다운로드해도 콘솔에서 RDP 파일 다운로드가 필요하여 수행 단계가 복잡함

* Remote Desktop Protocol (원격 데스크톱 프로토콜)

Q21
You have one GCP account running in your default region and zone and another account running in a non-default region and zone. You want to start a new
Compute Engine instance in these two Google Cloud Platform accounts using the command line interface. What should you do?
A. Create two configurations using gcloud config configurations create [NAME]. Run gcloud config configurations activate [NAME] to switch between accounts when running the commands to start the Compute Engine instances.
B. Create two configurations using gcloud config configurations create [NAME]. Run gcloud configurations list to start the Compute Engine instances.
C. Activate two configurations using gcloud configurations activate [NAME]. Run gcloud config list to start the Compute Engine instances.
D. Activate two configurations using gcloud configurations activate [NAME]. Run gcloud configurations list to start the Compute Engine instances.

A

Q24
You have a project for your App Engine application that serves a development environment. The required testing has succeeded and you want to create a new project to serve as your production environment. What should you do?
A. Use gcloud to create the new project, and then deploy your application to the new project.
B. Use gcloud to create the new project and to copy the deployed application to the new project.
C. Create a Deployment Manager configuration file that copies the current App Engine deployment into a new project.
D. Deploy your application again using gcloud and specify the project parameter with the new project name to create the new project.

A

Option B is wrong as the option to use gcloud app cp does not exist.
Option C is wrong as Deployment Manager does not copy the application, but allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml


Q27
You have sensitive data stored in three Cloud Storage buckets and have enabled data access logging. You want to verify activities for a particular user for these buckets, using the fewest possible steps. You need to verify the addition of metadata labels and which files have been viewed from those buckets. What should you do?
A. Using the GCP Console, filter the Activity log to view the information.
B. Using the GCP Console, filter the Stackdriver log to view the information.
C. View the bucket in the Storage section of the GCP Console.
D. Create a trace in Stackdriver to view the information.

A

활동 로깅은 앱 사용자의 요청을 참조하기 때문

활동 로그와 감사 로그는 모두 stackdriver 로그이나 활동 로그는 사용자의 요청을 참조하고

감사 로그는 관리자의 요청을 참조함. 질문은 특정 사용자의 활동을 확인하고 싶다고 함


Q28

(C) doesn't have control over the buckets.

Q29

You have an object in a Cloud Storage bucket that you want to share with an external company. The object contains sensitive data. You want access to the content to be removed after four hours. The external company does not have a Google account to which you can grant specific user-based access privileges. You want to use the most secure method that requires the fewest steps. What should you do?
A. Create a signed URL with a four-hour expiration and share the URL with the company.
B. Set object access to 'public' and use object lifecycle management to remove the object after four hours.
C. Configure the storage bucket as a static website and furnish the object's URL to the company. Delete the object from the storage bucket after four hours.
D. Create a new Cloud Storage bucket specifically for the external company to access. Copy the object to that bucket. Delete the bucket after four hours have passed.

A
Signed URL 사용하면 시간제한을 둘 수 있음
Answer C is incorrect because configuring the storage bucket as a static website would make the entire bucket contents available publicly, which is not secure.

Q30
You are creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a cluster autoscaler feature enabled. You need to make sure that each node of the cluster will run a monitoring pod that sends container metrics to a third-party monitoring solution. What should you do?
A. Deploy the monitoring pod in a StatefulSet object.

D는 IAM 내부에 있는 내용이라서 오답

To verify the IAM users and roles assigned within a GCP project, you can navigate to the project and then to the IAM section in the GCP Console. In the IAM section, you can review the members and roles assigned to the project. This will allow you to see who has what level of access to the project resources.

Answer A is incorrect because it lists the roles available in the project, but it does not show the IAM users and roles assigned to those roles.

Answer B is incorrect because it lists the service accounts in the project, but it does not show the IAM users and roles assigned to those service accounts.

Answer D is incorrect because it lists the roles available in the project, but it does not show the IAM users and roles assigned to those roles.

Q37
You created a Google Cloud Platform project with an App Engine application inside the project. You initially configured the application to be served from the us- central region. Now you want the application to be served from the asia-northeast1 region. What should you do?

Create an egress firewall rule with the following settings: ג€¢ Targets: all instances ג€¢ Source filter: IP ranges (with the range set to 10.0.1.0/24) ג€¢ Protocols: allow TCP: 8080

B

This question is designed to waste your time during the exam by making you read all those long answers. Remember that part of exam technique is not about knowing the product at all, but understanding multiple choice questions.

For example when two answers are very similar to each other, this can increase the likelihood that the correct answer is one of those two.

In this case it's an easy process of elimination as all answers are similar, we just need to filter out the wrong ones (and whacking the wrong answer in an exam is sometimes the best way to find the right one).

Two answers mention port 8080, and two mention all ports. Obviously we just need port 8080, so we can immediately eliminate those two questions that want all ports open. That gives us a 50/50 chance of getting this question right.

Of the remaining answers, one says "ingress" and the other "egress". We know that by default egress is permitted and ingress is not, so that makes "b" the only surviving choice.

Q54
You are given a project with a single Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and a single subnetwork in the us-central1 region. There is a Compute Engine instance hosting an application in this subnetwork. You need to deploy a new instance in the same project in the europe-west1 region. This new instance needs access to the application. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?
A. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.
B. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Expose the application with an internal load balancer. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the load balancer's address as the endpoint.
C. 1. Create a subnetwork in the same VPC, in europe-west1. 2. Use Cloud VPN to connect the two subnetworks. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.
D. 1. Create a VPC and a subnetwork in europe-west1. 2. Peer the 2 VPCs. 3. Create the new instance in the new subnetwork and use the first instance's private address as the endpoint.

A

ANSWER A is the correct answer because it follows Google's recommended practices of using a single VPC per project and creating a new subnetwork in the same VPC in the europe-west1 region. This allows the new instance to communicate with the existing instance using its private IP address as the endpoint.
ANSWER D is incorrect because VPC peering only works between VPCs in the same region, so it would not be possible to peer the existing VPC in us-central1 with a new VPC in europe-west1.

Q56

Q62
You want to run a single caching HTTP reverse proxy on GCP for a latency-sensitive website. This specific reverse proxy consumes almost no CPU. You want to have a 30-GB in-memory cache, and need an additional 2 GB of memory for the rest of the processes. You want to minimize cost. How should you run this reverse proxy?
A. Create a Cloud Memorystore for Redis instance with 32-GB capacity.
B. Run it on Compute Engine, and choose a custom instance type with 6 vCPUs and 32 GB of memory.
C. Package it in a container image, and run it on Kubernetes Engine, using n1-standard-32 instances as nodes.
D. Run it on Compute Engine, choose the instance type n1-standard-1, and add an SSD persistent disk of 32 GB.

A

ANSWER A is the most cost-effective solution for running a caching HTTP reverse proxy on GCP. Cloud Memorystore for Redis is a managed service that provides an in-memory cache for your applications. It offers a high throughput and low latency access to the Redis protocol. Cloud Memorystore offers an SLA of 99.9% availability and automatic failover for Redis instances. In this case, a 32-GB Redis instance is sufficient to accommodate the 30-GB cache and the additional 2 GB of memory required for the rest of the processes. This solution is highly scalable and allows you to increase the size of the Redis instance as your needs grow.

Answer D is wrong
This option involves using a general-purpose Compute Engine instance type with a relatively small amount of memory (n1-standard-1).
Adding an SSD persistent disk of 32 GB can be more expensive compared to using Cloud Memorystore for Redis.
While it's possible to achieve the desired configuration with Compute Engine, it might be overprovisioned in terms of CPU resources (n1-standard-1 has 1 vCPU).

Q63

You are hosting an application on bare-metal servers in your own data center. The application needs access to Cloud Storage. However, security policies prevent the servers hosting the application from having public IP addresses or access to the internet. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to provide the application with access to Cloud Storage. What should you do?
A. 1. Use nslookup to get the IP address for storage.googleapis.com. 2. Negotiate with the security team to be able to give a public IP address to the servers. 3. Only allow egress traffic from those servers to the IP addresses for storage.googleapis.com.
B. 1. Using Cloud VPN, create a VPN tunnel to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud. 2. In this VPC, create a Compute Engine instance and install the Squid proxy server on this instance. 3. Configure your servers to use that instance as a proxy to access Cloud Storage.
C. 1. Use Migrate for Compute Engine (formerly known as Velostrata) to migrate those servers to Compute Engine. 2. Create an internal load balancer (ILB) that uses storage.googleapis.com as backend. 3. Configure your new instances to use this ILB as proxy.
D. 1. Using Cloud VPN or Interconnect, create a tunnel to a VPC in Google Cloud. 2. Use Cloud Router to create a custom route advertisement for 199.36.153.4/30. Announce that network to your on-premises network through the VPN tunnel. 3. In your on-premises network, configure your DNS server to resolve *.googleapis.com as a CNAME to restricted.googleapis.com.

D

Google Cloud Interconnect is a service that provides a dedicated and high-bandwidth connection between your on-premises network and Google Cloud.

Here's the rationale for choosing Option D:

Secure Connection with VPN/Interconnect: By using Cloud VPN or Interconnect, you establish a secure connection between your on-premises network and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud. This ensures encrypted communication between your on-premises servers and Google Cloud.

Custom Route Advertisement: Cloud Router allows you to create custom route advertisements. By advertising a specific network (199.36.153.4/30), you can control the routing of traffic from your on-premises network to Google Cloud.

DNS Resolution: By configuring your DNS server to resolve *.googleapis.com as a CNAME to restricted.googleapis.com, you effectively redirect DNS requests for Cloud Storage to a restricted domain. This helps in adhering to security policies that prevent direct access to storage.googleapis.com.

Options A, B, and C are less suitable for the described scenario:

Option A: Giving public IP addresses to servers would violate the security policy. Restricting egress traffic to specific IP addresses may be challenging due to the dynamic nature of Google Cloud services.

Option B: While using a proxy is a common practice, it introduces an additional layer and may not be necessary in this scenario. It might also add complexity and latency to the data access.

Option C: Migrating servers to Compute Engine and using an internal load balancer for Cloud Storage access is a significant change that might not be necessary and could involve more complexity than needed.

Q64

A. 1. Create a Cloud Function that uses a Cloud Pub/Sub trigger on that topic. 2. Call your application on Cloud Run from the Cloud Function for every message.
B. 1. Grant the Pub/Sub Subscriber role to the service account used by Cloud Run. 2. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription for that topic. 3. Make your application pull messages from that subscription.
C. 1. Create a service account. 2. Give the Cloud Run Invoker role to that service account for your Cloud Run application. 3. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription that uses that service account and uses your Cloud Run application as the push endpoint.
D. 1. Deploy your application on Cloud Run on GKE with the connectivity set to Internal. 2. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription for that topic. 3. In the same Google Kubernetes Engine cluster as your application, deploy a container that takes the messages and sends them to your application.
