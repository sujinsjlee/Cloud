    - In summary, while the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator is used for estimating prospective costs before deploying resources, AWS Cost Explorer is used for analyzing and understanding past costs to optimize spending.
- AWS CloudHSM
    - Manage single-tenant **hardware** security modules (HSMs) on AWS
    - AWS CloudHSM helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security.

- Amazon Aurora
