- Elasticache helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- NOTE) Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

<!--83) A- Redshift is more for big data analytics/datawarehousing
B-how will the application know which one to query
C-fits well
D-SQS is not used for querying,it is used to decouple applications-->
